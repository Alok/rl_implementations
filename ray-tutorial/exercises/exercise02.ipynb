    "# Exercise 2 - Parallel Data Processing with Task Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to pass object IDs into remote functions to encode dependencies between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we construct a sequence of tasks each of which depends on the previous mimicking a data parallel application. Within each sequence, tasks are executed serially, but multiple sequences can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use Ray to parallelize the computation below and speed it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept for this Exercise - Task Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two remote functions defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments can be passed into remote functions as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x1_id = f.remote(1)\n",
    ">>> ray.get(x1_id)\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x2_id = f.remote([1, 2, 3])\n",
    ">>> ray.get(x2_id)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object IDs** can also be passed into remote functions. When the function actually gets executed, **the argument will be a retrieved as a regular Python object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> y1_id = f.remote(x1_id)\n",
    ">>> ray.get(y1_id)\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> y2_id = f.remote(x2_id)\n",
    ">>> ray.get(y2_id)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So when implementing a remote function, the function should expect a regular Python object regardless of whether the caller passes in a regular Python object or an object ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task dependencies affect scheduling.** In the example above, the task that creates `y1_id` depends on the task that creates `x1_id`. This has the following implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second task will not be executed until the first task has finished executing.\n",
    "- If the two tasks are scheduled on different machines, the output of the first task (the value corresponding to `x1_id`) will be copied over the network to the machine where the second task is scheduled."
